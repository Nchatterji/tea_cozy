    <h2> July 10, 2018 | Hello World! My first OFFICIAL webpage! I'm so psyched!</h2>

    <p> First day I was able ot launch a website from my laptop and the excitement is real! Today also marks the first day <br/>
    of my CodeAcademy Intensive class - which is a 10 week course ending 3 days before my 34th birthday. Needless to say <br/>
  if I can complete this course flawlessly, it would be an amazing birthday present to myself.</p>

    <p>Today, I attempled to roughly duplicate my company's website (<a href="https://www.pathmatics.com/" target="_blank">www.pathmatics.com)</a>
    And in 15 minutes, I did this:

    <h2> July 11, 2018 | Day 2 of learning code. Loving it more than yesterday! </h2>

    <p> It's only Day 2 and I completed Unit 1 which I was supposed to finish in 5 days #Overachiever. Hah! First time ever - maybe because <br/>
        I like the material so much...we'll see how long this lasts. Also, glanced at the rest of the course. So much more to go. <br/>
        One step at a time, right?</p>

    <p> Today, I was able to replicate a mock <a href="file:///Users/nchatterji/Downloads/F1U1P2_solution%202/project/index.html" target="_blank">site</a> in about 10-15 minutes with no mistakes (lucky) - which I was pretty proud of.<br/> In addition to which I started CSS!</p>

<h2> July 12, 2018 | Day 3. Confusion has hit.</h2>
<p>Today as I started learning more CSS, I found myself getting mixed up with all the tags, attributes, elements etc. I'm wondering if I rushed through the HTML section to quickly or if this is just a part of the learning curve. Refering back to HTML snippets have helped - let's see how it goes I guess. More importantly, today I learnt the basic structures <br/>
  around CSS and the coolest thing I did was link my style.css page to my Index.html page and saw the CSS shaping the HTML - pretty gnarly! More I learn the more I realize I'll have keep practising <strong>every.single.day</strong>!</p>

    <p>I linked my style.css page to my index.html (i.e.- DearMartix.html page)</p>

<!--just add the text-align:justify value to the css and saw it render the paragraph a lot better- wicked!-->
